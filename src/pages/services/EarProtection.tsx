          <h2>Our Custom Ear Protection Process</h2>
          <p>
            Creating your perfect custom ear protection involves a straightforward process:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Consultation:</strong> We discuss your specific protection needs, environments, and preferences to recommend the appropriate type of custom ear protection.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ear Impression:</strong> Our audiologist takes precise silicone impressions of your ear canals and outer ears, a quick and comfortable process that captures every contour.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Design Selection:</strong> You choose the appropriate sound filter technology, color options, and any additional features for your custom earplugs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Your ear impressions are sent to a specialized laboratory where your custom ear protection is precision-crafted using medical-grade materials.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fitting and Instruction:</strong> When your custom ear protection is ready (typically within 2-3 weeks), we ensure a perfect fit and provide detailed care and usage instructions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Follow-up Support:</strong> We offer ongoing support, adjustments if needed, and regular check-ups to ensure your ear protection continues to provide optimal protection.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>When Hearing Protection Is Essential</h3>
          <p>
            Hearing protection should be used in any environment where noise levels exceed 85 decibels (dB) for extended periods. Common situations requiring hearing protection include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Concert venues and music festivals (typically 100-120 dB)</li>
            <li>Sporting events (90-110 dB)</li>
            <li>Construction sites (90-110 dB)</li>
            <li>Manufacturing facilities (90-115 dB)</li>
            <li>Shooting ranges (140-170 dB impulse noise)</li>
            <li>Motorcycling (80-105 dB from wind and engine noise)</li>
            <li>Power tools and lawn equipment (90-110 dB)</li>
            <li>Nightclubs and bars (95-115 dB)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Remember that noise-induced hearing loss is cumulative and irreversible. Investing in quality custom ear protection now is an investment in your lifelong hearing health and quality of life.
