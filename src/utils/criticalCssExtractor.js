 * This is a utility module that would extract critical CSS from the application
 * It's not directly used in the runtime but would be part of the build process
 * 
 * For production, you would typically use a tool like criticalCSS, penthouse, or critical
 * Those tools would analyze your HTML and CSS to extract the critical CSS needed for above-the-fold content
 * 
 * The extracted CSS would then be inlined in the HTML head during the build process
